# Why it’s time to start talking about blockchain ethics

Blockchain technology is changing the nature of money and organizations. We should probably start pondering the potential consequences.

At first glance, the word “ethics” may seem out of place next to  “blockchain.” After all, the world of cryptocurrency may be most famous  for its many frauds and scams.

But according to a small contingent of academics, not only does it makes sense to discuss “blockchain ethics”—it is necessary.

If blockchain technology can be reasonably expected to make a significant  difference in society, then it deserves its own field of ethics, just  like biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and nuclear technology,  argues [Rhys Lindmark](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/rhysl/overview/), head of community and long-term societal impact at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative. 



Lindmark spoke October 6 at the group’s [Cryptoeconomic Systems Summit](https://www.media.mit.edu/events/cryptoeconomic-systems-field-building-summit/), a gathering of blockchain developers, economists, financial engineers,  lawyers, and others whose academic disciplines are relevant to the  technology. The summit was an attempt to lay the foundations for a new  academic field focused on the many interdisciplinary aspects of  blockchain development. Blockchain ethics might be considered a subfield of that. Lindmark described it as “a group of people focused on the  question: How we can positively shape the development of this  technology?”

Blockchain technology is still mostly a niche  interest; the value of the cryptocurrency market is minuscule compared  with the value of traditional global investment markets. It doesn’t have much influence, if any, in the global financial system—rather,  cryptocurrencies are mostly seen as a way to profit by speculating on  their volatile prices. But that may be changing. Big mainstream  institutions like [Fidelity Investments](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613090/blockchain-boosters-warn-that-regulatory-uncertainty-is-harming-innovation/) and [Intercontinental Exchange](https://www.technologyreview.com/f/614418/the-owner-of-the-new-york-stock-exchange-is-now-in-the-bitcoin-business/) (which owns the New York Stock Exchange) have embraced the technology. Facebook wants to launch [its own global digital currency](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613801/facebooks-libra-three-things-we-dont-know-about-the-digital-currency/). Central banks may be [close to getting into the business too](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614472/should-central-banks-issue-digital-currency-suddenly-its-an-urgent-question/).

Lindmark said that like other “tech ethics” fields, the field of blockchain  ethics should examine what the technology is capable of doing, and  ponder the potential consequences. For instance, blockchains make it  possible to create leaderless, “decentralized” organizations. Does that  mean no one is responsible if something goes wrong? In public  blockchains like Bitcoin, the network’s shared software rules are  supposed to automatically sort out what behavior is allowed. So if a  user exploits the protocol for profit without breaking its rules, is  that unethical? Meanwhile, global digital currencies like what Facebook  is proposing might change the nature of money. How might that change  politics and power dynamics?

A concrete, near-term concern pertains to blockchain research. Much  like biotechnologies and nanotechnologies, blockchains and  cryptocurrencies introduce a new class of “ethical risks” for  researchers, said [Quinn DuPont](https://people.ucd.ie/quinn.dupont), an assistant professor at University College Dublin. 

The blockchain field should work toward standardizing guidelines for  ethical research, he said, because studying crypto networks—for  instance, probing and disclosing security vulnerabilities—can put other  people’s money at risk. One of the slides from DuPont’s talk at the MIT  conference featured a [Twitter poll](https://twitter.com/phildaian/status/960620732307918848?lang=en) posted last year by [Philip Daian](https://pdaian.com/), a researcher at Cornell University’s Initiative for Cryptocurrencies  and Contracts. Daian asked if it’s ethical to assign students to find a  vulnerability in a live blockchain smart contract. Two-thirds of the  1,262 respondents said yes.

Traditional computer security research faces a similar quandary. But  in proceeding with research like this on a blockchain, “you’re not just  breaking into a social network or some other system which may be  relatively important,” DuPont said. “You’re literally teaching them how  to break into the bank.”
