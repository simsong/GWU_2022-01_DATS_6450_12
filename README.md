## COURSE DESCRIPTION
Ethical issues are increasingly at center of developing, deploying and using data science. Efforts to supplement human with artificial intelligence create systems that can impact the wellbeing, happiness, and even the lives of human beings without oversight or failsafe controls. Such systems need more than precision and accuracy: they need to reflect the ethical principles of the world in which we wish to live.

This course introduces a range of ethical topics that are relevant to today s data scientists, starting with a brief introduction to ethical systems, intellectual property and wicked problems. Next, the course analyzes topical ethical problems that have resulted through the deployment of data science and information technology. Finally, the course explores approaches that have been put forth to solve these problems.
Classes are mostly discussions employing the case study method. Labs explore key issues in at the intersection of data science and ethics. Students enrolling in this class should have a working knowledge of Python and machine learning.

### Course prerequisites, if any

None

### Learning outcomes that state descriptions of behaviors or skills that students will be able to demonstrate at the end of the course or unit
At the conclusion of the course, students will be able to:

1. Identify and discuss major ethical issues involving information and computing of the past 50 years.
2. Explain multiple sides of current ethical and policy issues regarding in the areas of machine learning, autonomous systems, privacy, encryption and computer security.
3. Analyze ethical conflicts using established ethical frameworks.
4. Asses and write about a subject using a neutral point of view.
5. Edit and publish articles using the Mediawiki platform

### Average amount of direct instruction or guided interaction with the instructor and average minimum amount of independent (out-of-class) learning expected per week

Classes will be conducted seminar-style in which the assigned readings will be reviewed and the topics discussed.
Students are therefore expected to complete the assigned readings prior to the class start.
Class discussions will consist of in-person discussions, material posted and edited in the Wikipedia  sandbox,  and asynchronous written discussions using Blackboard.

Dr. Garfinkel is available outside of class hours for in-person meetings (COVID-19 rules permitting), one-on-one phone calls and video chats to discuss the course material, including the readings and the assignments.

Two hours and thirty minutes are allocated for class discussion once a week, although some classes may be dismissed early. Each class will consist of:
* Class administrivia, including preview of upcoming assignment (5-10 min)
* Student presentations (if any)
* Recap of reading
* Break
* Class discussion

Students should budget at least 30 minutes for participation on the blackboard website during the week and not less than **six hours each week** to complete the readings and assignments.

# Assignments and Grading
This course has ten credit opportunities: **W1** and **W2** are writing assignments;
**P1**, **P2** and **P3** are in-class class presentations; **D1** and **D2** data analysis labs;
**C1** and **C2** are grades for in-class participation; **O1** and **O2** are for online participation.

The two data analysis labs can be completed using web-based resources: all that is required is a web browser, although students may wish to run the assignments locally on a computer with at least 4GB of RAM running MacOS, Linux or Windows.
Students who lack data analysis skills using python may arrange for additional one-on-one help from Dr. Garfinkel so that they can complete the data analysis assignments.

Assignments are due on the indicated due dates, but extensions are granted liberally.
Points are not automatically deducted for late assignments,
but grading standards rise substantially after homework is discussed electronically, in class, or after solutions are distributed.
Students are encouraged to get their work in on time, rather than have it build up.
No extension is offered on the Wikipedia assignment.
