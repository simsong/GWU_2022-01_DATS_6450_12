[Digital Maoism](http://www.edge.org/conversation/jaron_lanier-digital-maoism-the-hazards-of-the-new-online-collectivism) article:
* This article is 15 years old. Is it still relevant?
* Why does he use the term “Maoism” ?  Is it accurate?
  * [Mao·ism](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=define+maoism)| ˈmouˌizəm | noun the communist doctrines of Mao Zedong as formerly practiced in China, having as a central idea permanent revolution and stressing the importance of the peasantry, small-scale industry, and agricultural collectivization.
* The online version of the article has comments by many notable people, including Jimmy Wales, who writes "The best guiding principle is to always cherish individuals first."
  * Should we privilege what Wales writes because he is the founder of Wikimedia?
  * Does Wikipedia uphold this best guiding principle?
* Did Wikipedia correct itself?

[Wikipedia And the Meaning of Truth](https://www.technologyreview.com/2008/10/20/218162/wikipedia-and-the-meaning-of-truth/)

* Is it a problem that Wikipedia standards privilege secondary sources over primary sources?
* Does the Wikipedia ecosystem unduly privilege open access sources?
  * Is this a problem for scientific writing in general?
  * What is the impact on the information economy?
